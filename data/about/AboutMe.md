## Hello

I'm Evan, I'm currently the Lead Frontend Engineer at Visma Labs, I'm primarily working on the Visma InSchool Project. 
I'm a full stack developer, using a Full Stack range of JS technologies, e.g. MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS, Typescript.

I have Authored a number of NPM packages such as Rabbitode, JS-File-Req and many more. 


My name is Evan, I've been a developer now for the past 4 years working mainly with frontend technologies in my day job, 
but at the same time exploring the backend through NodeJS, MongoDB, Sql and much more. At the moment I am a Senior Frontend Engineer
at VSWare, an education cloud services provider based in Dublin City Center, with clients in Norway, Uk and Ireland. In the past I have worked for Risk.Ident Gmbh, in Hamburg, who provide a Machine Learning fraud prevention platform. Before that I 
worked for Blueface, a VOIP phone company based in Dublin who are one of the leading retailers in the field. 

I have authored a number of NPM packages the first one [Rabbitode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbitode?target=_blank) is a package which allows you 
to easily interface the the RabbitMQ library. Another package is the [JS-File-Req package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-file-req?target=_blank) which quickly
allows you to import the files and folders of a subfolder within your application. All of these packages are open source and can be worked on.
