  Little bit about me

## Hello

Hi I'm Evan, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at HubSpot based in their Dublin offices. Prior to this I've worked for Visma Labs, Blueface and Risk.Ident.

I'm a full stack developer, using a Full Stack range of JS technologies, e.g. MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS, Typescript.
 
I have authored a number of NPM packages
 <ul>
   <li>
       <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n-cloud-sync" target="_blank"> i18n-cloud-sync </a>
     </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbitode" target="_blank"> Rabbitode </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-file-req" target="_blank"> JS-File-Req package </a>
    </li>
 </ul> 
    <br />
 All of these packages are open source and can be used free of charge.

Currently I am conducting research into micro frontends and how to use them at scale.
