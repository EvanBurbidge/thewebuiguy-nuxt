## Hello

I'm Evan, I'm currently the Lead Frontend Engineer at Visma Labs, I'm primarily working on the Visma InSchool Project. 
I'm a full stack developer, using a Full Stack range of JS technologies, e.g. MongoDB, ExpressJS, VueJS, Typescript.
 
I have authored a number of NPM packages the first one <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rabbitode" target="_blank"> Rabbitode </a> is a package which allows you 
to easily interface the the RabbitMQ library. Another package is the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-file-req" target="_blank"> JS-File-Req package </a> which quickly
allows you to import the files and folders of a sub-folder's within your application. All of these packages are open source and can be used free of charge.

In the past I have worked for the companies Blueface and Risk.Ident Gmbh.

Currently I am conducting research into micro frontends and how to use them at scale.
